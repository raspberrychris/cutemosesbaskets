## Baby Girl Names Based on Greek Mythology:

The Ancient Greek Goddesses Provide Many Unique Names

Tales of Greek gods and goddesses dates back to 2200 B.C. The women who called ancient Greece home were strong and powerful, making their names perfect choices for unique names for newborn girls.

## Aphrodite

Parents searching for a name that automatically conjures up images of love and beauty should look no further than the goddess Aphrodite. The goddess of love, beauty and fertility was also known as a quick-tempered, mercurial young woman.

Homer writes that Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus and Dione. In his tale of the Trojan War, he spins a story of Zeus admonishing his daughter, telling her to leave matters of war to her brother Ares. Zeus tells Aphrodite that she should instead focus on marriage and matters of the heart. Her Roman equivalent is Venus.

## Artemis
For a name that captures a sporty feel, Artemis is a good choice. Artemis could be considered the original tomboy. She was depicted as the virgin (young) goddess of the hunt. Artemis is often depicted together with her twin brother Apollo. She assisted women with childbirth, but was also quick to kill with an arrow from her quiver constantly strapped to her back. Her Roman equivalent is Diana.

## Athena

The patron goddess of Athens, Athena was primarily the goddess of arts and crafts, but also of war. Athena is also considered the goddess of wisdom because of her birth myth. When her father Zeus was married to Metis, a woman renowned for her wisdom, she became pregnant. Zeus was warned that if Metis gave birth to a son, he would overthrow him, just as Zeus had overthrown his own father.

To prevent this, Zeus swallowed Metis. He was soon overcome with a splitting headache. To relieve his pain, he asked the craftsman god Hephaestus to hit Zeus’ forehead with an ax. Athena jumped out of Zeus’ head in full armour. Her Roman equivalent is Minerva.

## Demeter

For a name that embodies nature and the outdoors, Demeter should come to mind. The goddess of agriculture, Demeter was Zeus’ sister and Persephone’s mother. Homer wrote that Demeter was heartbroken when her daughter was taken to the underground world to be Hades’ queen. She wandered the earth in search of her daughter. During this time, crops withered and died, bringing on perpetual winter.

Eventually, Hades was persuaded to allow Persephone to spend half the year with him underground, and the other half above with Demeter, dividing the year into the barren season, and the fertile half. When depicted in art, Demeter is often shown carrying a sheaf of grain to represent her connection with agriculture and nature. Her Roman equivalent is Ceres.

## Persephone

Persephone is often associated with innocence because of Homer’s tale in the Odyssey of Persephone’s abduction by Hades. Her myth was also used to explain the natural processes of the seasons, with spring and summer bringing about flowers and crops, and fall and summer punctuated by barren fields.

She is often depicted in art robed and carrying a sheaf of grain. She is often smiling demurely, representative of her eternal role as the innocent maiden. While she does not have an exact Roman equivalent, the Romans told her tale from the Greeks, sometimes changing her name to Proserpine.

Mums and dads spend much of the pregnancy searching for just the right name for their baby. Turning to ancient Greek for a name such as Aphrodite, Athena, Demeter, Athena, or Persephone, parents can choose a name that is time-honoured and steeped in myth, as well as meaning.


## Baby Boy Names That Begin With W: Unusual & Popular Male Name Choices

Looking for a baby boy name that begins with W? With help from the U.S. Social Security Baby Name Index, here are some popular, classic, and unusual choices.

William. William has always been an extremely popular name in the United States, as well as in Great Britain, Australia, and Canada. In America, it finally dropped out of the top 10 in the 1970s, but then it started climbing again and ranked at #10 in 2020. Why the enduring popularity of this name? Perhaps it has to do with nicknames, as William has versatility. For years, Billys and Bills abounded, and these days, parents are using the nickname Liam (the second part of William). William comes from an ancient Germanic name that means "determined protector."

Wyatt. Wyatt is both a Western sounding name and a last-name-turned-first-name, so it's not surprising that this name is becoming trendy, It ranked at #82 in 2020. Wyatt comes from an Old English name that means "war strength."

Wesley. Wesley cracked the top 100 during the 1980s, but fell to #190 in 2020. Wesley comes from an Old English name that means "Western meadow." For something a little different, try Weston.

Walter. Walter was big in the early twentieth century, when Walter Cronkite and Wally Cleaver were born. The name gradually become less common and has fallen out of favor. Parents in search of an old-fashioned name that hasn't become trendy yet might snatch up this classic. Walter comes from an ancient Germanic name that means "commander of the army."

Warren. Warren has always been Walter's less popular younger brother. The name was fairly popular during the 1920s, but isn't used much anymore. Unlike Walter, Warren doesn't have any built-in nicknames ("Warry" just doesn't sound all that upbeat). Warren comes from a Norman French name that means "stockyard."

Walker, Wilson, & Whittaker. If you like the last-name-turned-first-name craze but want a name that isn't overly popular, try out one of these. Walker is from an Old English name that means "clothes washer." Wilson, as you might guess, means "son of William." Whittaker is from an Old English name that means "wheat farm."
Wade & Wayne. These names have a lot to offer-- they're short, strong, a little bit Western, and not the least bit trendy. Wade is from an Old English name that means "able to go." Wayne is from an Old English name that means "wagon builder."

Waylon. Like country names? Here's a classic that isn't used much. Waylon comes from an Old English name that means "roadside land."

Winston. Thanks to Winston Churchill, this unusual name has a strong and historical appeal. Winston comes from an Old English name that means "joyful stone."

Woodrow & Woody. Sadly, the sexual connotations of "woody" might make this name fodder for playground bullies. These names come from an English expression that means "row of house by the woods."
Waldo, Wilmer, & Wilbur. Old-fashioned names are making a comeback, but don't expect to see these clunkers anytime soon.

## Baby Boy Names That Begin With M: Popular and Unusual Male Name Choices

If you're looking for a baby boy name that starts with the letter M, you'll find lots of choices. According to the U.S. Social Security Baby Name Index, M is the first letter of some of the most popular baby names in America, as well as plenty of uncommon choices as well.

## Popular and Trendy Baby Boy Names That Start With M

•	Michael. Michael was the #1 name in the United States from 1954 until 1998, when Jacob finally pushed Michael into the #2 spot. During the Baby Boom, when casual names were more prevalent, Mike was a common stand-alone name-- but it isn't any longer. Michael comes from a Hebrew expression that means" who resembles God." For a less common variation, try Mitchell.

•	Matthew. Ranking at #5 in 202006, Matthew has been in the top 10 since 1972. This New Testament Biblical name comes from a Hebrew expression that means "God's gift." For something more unusual, try Matteo.
•	Mason. Mason's a last-name-turned-first-name with a Western sound-- two factors that account for its current trendiness. Rarely used as a first name in the past, it ranked at #39 in 202006. The meaning of Mason is the same as the word-- "one who works with stone."

•	Miguel. One of the more popular Spanish name choices, this Spanish equivalent of Michael ranked at #89 in 202006. Manuel, a Spanish name with a similar sound that means "God is with us," ranked at #161.
•	Mark. A top 10 name during the 1960s, Mark has dropped down to #129. Marcus, which also used to be rmore popular, ranked at #112. A New Testament name, Mark comes from a Latin name that means "dedicated to Mars," who was the Roman war god. For a different twist, try Marco.

•	Micah. Looking for a less common variation of Michael? Micah was ranked at #148 in 202006, and like many less common Hebrew names, it's gaining in popularity. Also rising in popularity quickly is Malachi, a Hebrew name which means "messenger."

•	Max & Maxwell. Previously seen by many parents as way too old-fashioned, these names are coming back. In 202006, Max ranked at #160, and Maxwell ranked at #149. Max comes from a Latin name that means "the greatest," and Maxwell comes from an Old English expression that means "Mac's stream."

## Unusual Baby Boy Names That Start With M

•	Martin & Malcolm. Of these two African American leader names, Martin is more popular these days. Both are strong and classic alternatives to more popular M names. Martin has the same origin as Mark, and Malcolm comes from a Gaelic place name.

•	Marius & Mario. Both of these names have distinctive pop culture namesakes-- the romantic hero in Les Miserables and the lovelorn video game plumber, respectively. Both come from a Latin name that means "manly."

•	Marlon & Marlo. These nifty Hollywood names aren't used much anymore. They are related to a Hebrew place name.

•	Morgan. This last-name-turned-first-name has become trendy for girls, but originated as a boy's name. Morgan is from a Welsh expression that means "circling sea." Another last-name-turned-first-name, Maddox, is becoming more popular-- it's the name of Brangelina's oldest son.

•	Mohamed. As the Muslim population of the U.S. grows, this name is becoming more common. Mohamed is the most common spelling, but it's also commonly spelled Mohammed and Mohammad. Mohamed was the most significant prophet in Islam, and the name means "praiseworthy" in Arabic.

•	Moses. Here's one Biblical name that has never really caught on. Moses comes from a Hebrew name meaning "saviour."

•	Miles & Milo. These two M names sound like they could be trendy, but they aren't. They come from a Latin expression meaning "soldier."

•	Marvin, Melvin, Murray, Morris, & Marshall. Are these names so far out that they're never coming back? Perhaps. They certainly conjure up images of pleasant elderly fellows playing checkers in Boca Raton. But to some, these old-fashioned names may be retro chic for a little boy.
