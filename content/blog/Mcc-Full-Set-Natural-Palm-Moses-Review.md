#### Customers Say about this product

>  "The picture does not give justice to this wonderful moses basket. This has been the single most practical baby item in our household. It rocks, it is easy to move around and it is very sturdy. Unfortunately, our baby son has outgrown it now. Yet, we still put him in it from time to time when we are moving him from one place to another. The basket arrived from France and we loved it from the first moment it arrived."
