#### Customers Say about this product

>  "Lovely looking basket. The mattress feels a bit flimsy and maybe could have done with a touch more padding, but I'm hoping that it will be comfortable enough for baby once she is in there. Good value for money, looks well made with lovely lacing and seems fairly easy to wash when necessary."
